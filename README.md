I believe in tech for good, and tech for everyone.

I'm a data scientist interested in contributing to the data science and machine learning ecosystem, as well as building software. Expect to see a lot of such projects in my repositories listed below.

You'll also see that I contribute a lot to pyParakeets; a data science dev group I formed with other data people. Feel free to reach out to learn more or if you want to join us.

## Projects

### Python Package for Benford's Law Analysis
<p>
  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/benfords-law/"><img width="200" align='left' src="https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/2b7a7c253b904d1264fc8ba4ea57ad1920bb24f6/68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f6d6177756c6961646a65692f62656e666f7264735f6c61772f6d61696e2f696d616765732f62656e666f7264735f6c61775f646973747269627574696f6e2e706e67"></a>

I got thoroughly intrigued by Benford's Law; a weird and myterious mathematical law that applies to many sets of numbers.

Analysis done with this law is incredibly powerful and has been used by forensic auditors to find tax fraud, among many other use cases. I built an open source python package and published it to the pypi index, making it globally available for all analysis.

### Resurrecting Beethoven with LTSMs

</p>
In this project, my team and I spent time using Deep Learning to create music, by working primarily with LSTMs.

We took data from child prodigy Beethoven and the British band Queen, and we used meaningful learned patterns to create 'new' music. Feel free to go through the code in my repository. Even better, read the article I wrote that explains how we went about it by clicking on Beethoven's face lol
