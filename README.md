I believe in tech for good, and tech for everyone.

I'm a data scientist interested in contributing to the data science and machine learning ecosystem, as well as building software. Expect to see a lot of such projects in my repositories listed below.

You'll also see that I contribute a lot to pyParakeets; a data science dev group I formed with other data people. Feel free to reach out to learn more or if you want to join us.

If you want to check out what I'm doing professionally, feel free to visit my LinkedIn by clicking on my face to the right lol


## Projects

### Resurrecting Beethoven with LTSMs
In this project, my team and I spent time using Deep Learning to create music, by working primarily with LSTMs.

We took data from child prodigy Beethoven and the British band Queen, and we used meaningful learned patterns to create 'new' music. Feel free to go through the code in my repository. Even better, read the article I wrote that explains how we went about it by clicking on Beethoven's face lol
