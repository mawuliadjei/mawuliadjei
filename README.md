I believe in tech for good, and tech for everyone.

I'm a data scientist interested in contributing to the data science and machine learning ecosystem, as well as building software. Expect to see a lot of such projects in my repositories listed below.

You'll also see that I contribute a lot to pyParakeets; a data science dev group I formed with other data people. Feel free to reach out to learn more or if you want to join us.

## Projects

### Python Package for Benford's Law Analysis
<p>
  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/benfords-law/"><img width="200" align='left' src="https://warehouse-camo.ingress.cmh1.psfhosted.org/4977c522ac7cf3f4e00017da8f9a98232b3f2daa/68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f6d6177756c6961646a65692f62656e666f7264735f6c61772f6d61696e2f696d616765732f706f70756c6174696f6e735f62656e666f7264735f6c61772e706e67"></a>

I got thoroughly intrigued by Benford's Law; a weird and myterious mathematical law that applies to many sets of numbers so I developed a set of tools for applying it.

Analysis done with this law is incredibly powerful and has been used by forensic auditors to find tax fraud, among many other use cases. I built an open source python package and published it to the pypi index, making it globally available for all to use and derive value from. Go ahead and ```pip install -U benfords-law``` üòÑ

### Python Package for Threshold Optimization
As a data scientist, I've always had to build predictive classification models. I've always known that it's important to tune the decision boundary that is used to convert probabilities to classes. So I decided to turn my knowledge into a package that will help other data scientists perform this part of the pipeline even faster.

The threshold optimization package is built to accept input of predicted probabilities and their corresponding true classes from a validation set during the modeling process. It outputs the optimal decision boundary/threshold for a specified set of metrics. Go ahead and ```pip install -U threshold-optimizer```

### Resurrecting Beethoven with LTSMs
<p>

</p>
In this project, my team and I spent time using Deep Learning to create music, by working primarily with LSTMs.

We took data from child prodigy Beethoven and the British band Queen, and we used meaningful learned patterns to create 'new' music. Feel free to go through the code in my repository. Even better, read the article I wrote that explains how we went about it by clicking on Beethoven's face lol
