### Hey ✌🏻

I believe in tech for good, and tech for everyone.

I'm a data scientist interested in contributing to the data science and machine learning ecosystem, as well as building software. Expect to see a lot of such projects in my repositories.

You'll also see that I contribute a lot to pyParakeets; a data science dev group I formed with other data people. Feel free to reach out to learn more or if you want to join us.
