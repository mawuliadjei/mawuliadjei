### Hey ‚úåüèª

I believe in tech for good, and tech for everyone.

I'm a data scientist interested in contributing to the data science and machine learning ecosystem, as well as building software. Expect to see a lot of such projects in my repositories listed below.

You'll also see that I contribute a lot to pyParakeets; a data science dev group I formed with other data people. Feel free to reach out to learn more or if you want to join us.

If you want to check out what I'm doing professionally, feel free to visit my LinkedIn
